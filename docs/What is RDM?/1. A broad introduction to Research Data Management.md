Publications are just the visible output of research. Most of the work of scholarship happens within the vast amount of materials that underlie each publication: the research data.</p>


## Core values

### Research integrity ****

<p align="justify">"In our modern knowledge society, scientific and scholarly research has thereby acquired an indispensable role. In providing knowledge and understanding of all aspects of reality, science and scholarship also provide the building blocks for political decision-making and the stimulus for societal development and economic growth (...) </p>
<p align="justify">If scientific and scholarly research is to perform this role properly, research integrity is essential. Researchers who are not guided by the principles of honesty, scrupulousness, transparency, independence and responsibility risk harming both the quality and the trustworthiness of research"</p>
