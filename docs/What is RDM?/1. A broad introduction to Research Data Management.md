## Why do we talk about research data?
Publications are just the visible output of research. Most of the work of scholarship happens within the vast amount of materials that underlie each publication: the research data.

## Core values of responsible conduct in research data management 

### Research integrity

Standards of conduct for scientific integrity are laid out in codes of conduct, such as

> **[The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://www.nwo.nl/en/netherlands-code-conduct-research-integrity), 2018**
>"If scientific and scholarly research is to perform this role properly, research integrity is essential. Researchers who are not guided by the **principles of honesty, scrupulousness, transparency, independence and responsibility** risk harming both the quality and the trustworthiness of research."

>**[The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/European-Code-of-Conduct-Revised-Edition-2023.pdf), Revised edition 2023**
>  “Good research practices are based on **fundamental principles** of research integrity. They **guide individuals, institutions, and organisations** in their work as well as in their engagement with the practical, ethical, and intellectual challenges inherent in research.”

 <center>**Reliability**</center>
 <center>in ensuring the quality of research which is reflected in the design, methodology, analysis and use of resources.</center>
 <center>**Honesty**</center>
 <center>in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a transparent, fair, full, and unbiased way.</center>
<center>**Respect**</center>
<center>for colleagues, research subjects, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the environment.</center>

<center>Accountability</center>
<center>for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and finally for its wider societal impacts.</center>

⭐️ In order to prevent research data from being invented, fabricated or falsified (intentionally manipulated or misinterpreted) and to stimulate reproducibility, a **transparent researcher clarifies on what data he/she bases conclusions and how these data were collected.** 

### Reproducibility

Research is considered to be reproducible when researchers provide all the necessary data, metadata, software and computer scripts enabling the research to be reconstructed or making it possible to re-analyse the research data.

> [! Note]
> "Reproducibility means that research data and code are made available so that others are able to reach the same results as are claimed in scientific outputs" | [The Open Science Training Book, 2018]([https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/en/02OpenScienceBasics/04ReproducibleResearchAndDataAnalysis.html](https://book.fosteropenscience.eu/en/02OpenScienceBasics/04ReproducibleResearchAndDataAnalysis.html))

Setting up reproducible research requires extensive preparation in the planning phase. Research data which are not accurately managed risk not being reusable, which lowers the possibilities of reproducing the research itself. 

## Data management vocabulary 

This section should clarify the meaning of some of most commonly used terms in research data management activities
### Research Data 
The meaning of the research data heavily depends on the scientific discipline. Below are provided a few definitions which outline the main features and ways of considering research data. 

> **[OECD](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/38500813.pdf), 2007**
> "Research data are the **factual records** (numerical scores, textual records, images and sounds) **used as primary sources for scientific research**, and that are commonly accepted in the scientific community as **necessary to validate research findings**. A research data set constitutes a systematic, partial representation of the subject being investigated." 

> **[Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/university_policy_framework_for_research_data_utrecht_university_-_january_2016.pdf), 2016**
> "Research data constitute **primary research data** (the raw, rough measurements or observation) and **secondary research data** (the results after the data have been processed by a researcher (recoded, combined, categorised, visualised, etc.))." 

> **[Van Berchum & Grootveld](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11755/a9539a60-ecef-4e62-a998-0fda190b303b), 2017**
> "Research data may be **facts, observations, interviews, recordings, measurements, experiments, simulations and software**; **numerical, descriptive and visual**; **raw, cleaned up and processed**; they **may or may not support an actual or intended publication**; and may be **stored and exchanged in various formats on various storage media**."

🎯 Research data can be: 
- information collected or produced in the course of scientific activity. 
- considered as evidence needed to validate research conclusions and results, and can be classified in various ways. 
- different between raw/primary data, i.e. the direct result of measurement or collection, and secondary data, when reusing data produced by others.
- numeric, textual, or multimedia, for instance, statistics, digital image collections, sound recordings, interview transcripts, etc. are considered data. 

**So when we talk about ‘research data’ we are using a generic term that can refer to a variety of information and contents, expressed in different formats, and that can be creative or factual in nature.**
