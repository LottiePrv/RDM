## Why do we talk about research data?
Publications are just the visible output of research. Most of the work of scholarship happens within the vast amount of materials that underlie each publication: the research data.

## Core values

### Research integrity
##### **[Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://nwo.nl/en/netherlands-code-conduct-research-integrity), 2018**
"In our modern knowledge society, scientific and scholarly research has thereby acquired an indispensable role. In providing knowledge and understanding of all aspects of reality, science and scholarship also provide the building blocks for political decision-making and the stimulus for societal development and economic growth (...)
If scientific and scholarly research is to perform this role properly, research integrity is essential. **Researchers who are not guided by the principles of honesty, scrupulousness, transparency, independence and responsibility risk harming both the quality and the trustworthiness of research**"

##### **[The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/European-Code-of-Conduct-Revised-Edition-2023.pdf), Revised edition 2023**
 “Good research practices are based on **fundamental principles** of research integrity. They guide individuals, institutions, and organisations in their work as well as in their engagement with the practical, ethical, and intellectual challenges inherent in research.”

Principles : 
 - **Reliability** in ensuring the quality of research which is reflected in the design, methodology, analysis and use of resources. 
 - **Honesty** in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a transparent, fair, full, and unbiased way. 
 - **Respect** for colleagues, research subjects, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the environment.
 - **Accountability** for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and finally for its wider societal impacts.

⭐️ In order to prevent research data from being invented, fabricated or falsified (intentionally manipulated or misinterpreted) and to stimulate reproducibility, a **transparent researcher clarifies on what data he/she bases conclusions and how these data were collected.**
