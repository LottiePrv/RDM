### How do I arrange notes as sections and pages?

By default, the sections and pages will follow the folder structure within `/docs`. The folders and sub-folders will show up as sections. Try not to have white spaces in your folder and file names, as these will be converted to HTML links. The webpage heading will be the same as the first-level heading in the markdown note.

- If you would like to arrange the pages manually, then use the `nav` option in the `mkdocs.yml` [configuration file](https://www.mkdocs.org/#adding-pages) at the root of this repo  to set custom page navigation.
    - For example, see the setup for [the Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/) at [github](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/blob/master/mkdocs.yml). Managing each page using `nav` can become cumbersome as the number of notes increase though!
- The Materials theme provides multiple options to arrange [sections](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#navigation-sections), use [navigation tabs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#navigation-tabs), and many other helpful [navigation setups](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/)
